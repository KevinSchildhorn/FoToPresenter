# UX

My goal with this project was to go through all of the design steps that a typical MVP project would go through.
This started off by deciding on what kind of UX my app would have. Generally this starts with User stores,
then moves to use cases.

While the User stories are all located in one file, the Use cases are separated based on the experiences the user would go through.
