# UX

My goal with this project was to go through all of the design steps that a typical MVP project would go through.
This started off by deciding on what kind of UX my app would have. Generally this starts with User stores,
then moves to use cases.

While the User stories are all located in one file, the Use cases are separated based on the experiences the user would go through.

* [User Stories](USER_STORIES.md)

# Process

This doc will go over the process of creating an app from scratch, and the current progress

## UX Design

The first step of the process was to design what the app is, and what it does.

### 1. User Stories
* I started with User Stories, seeing what the user wants from the app, and why they would use the app

### 2. Use Cases
* I then added some uses cases, wanting to decide what the user expects to happen in the application.
    * From these use cases I am also able to create UML diagrams, to specify what each element should contain, generally speaking (Such as a screen having a search bar and performing a search action).

### 3. UI Research
* Once I knew what the user wanted to see, I went to research existing UI elements. Since I knew this app would be a gallery I researched what photo services such as google photos and flickr do in their apps and sites. In the future I will also research login screens and also gallery screens from other applications.

### 4. Decisions

* After that I moved onto the general design decisions. With both research and Use Cases I am able to decide on what elements should generally look like.
    * From the use cases I was able to make assumptions on the UX, which I wrote in the Thoughts on design for the research. For example what size and shape the photos in an element should be.

### 5. UI Design

I then made a figma for my designs and concepts. I also decided to make a page including the general theme of the app, including fonts, typography and colors. Here I added components and UI elements for the Gallery screen, and for the sign in screen. From here I can use these components to create the UI on mobile.
