# Notes on Photo Browsing Organization

## Description of research

### Visuals

* Directories appear as Folder icons
* Shows title, date
* Some examples show the amount of items
* Some examples have option menu

## Thoughts on design

* Directories should appear as folder icons
* They should show the title, and the amount of items in the directory
* Should have NO option button, but you can long press to start a slideshow
* Should match similar functionality to groupings but with different visual style
