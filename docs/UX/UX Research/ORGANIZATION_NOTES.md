# Notes on Photo Browsing Organization


## Description of research

### Organization

* Some examples sort and organize photos into sections based on date
* Some examples have sorting based on name, date, size, etc

### Top Bar

* Some examples have a top navigation bar to show where in the directory the user is currently Browsing
* Some examples have search bars to look for items

### Side Bar

* Some examples contain side navigation bars. These can be expanded or collapsed as a hamburger menu. These are usually to select different types of files, or different directories or locations of files. They can also include groupings of photos or navigation to settings


## Thoughts on design

### Organization

* Photos should be organized by name by default, and the ability to sort should be enabled for date ascending or descending. There is no reason to show file size or other variables

### Top Bar

* Top navigation bar should show what directory in the FTP server the user is browsing.
* Different directories should be clickable to navigate to that directory.
* Search bar should be accessible to search for directories. It won't be as beneficial for searching for photos as most will have names such as IMG_12345.png.

### Side Bar

* Side bar should appear as expandable on the left side of the screen.
* It should contain the base directories of the FTP site for easy navigation
* It should also contain groupings or playlists
* It should finally contain navigation to settings
