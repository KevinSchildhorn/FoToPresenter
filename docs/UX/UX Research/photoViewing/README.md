# Notes on Photo Browsing Visuals

## Description of research

### Shape

* Photos appear as squares mostly
  * If not as squares, they appear in rows of the same height, and aspected width
* Photos can be completely square or rounded corners

### Title
* Some examples have text of the file name, others just show the photo
* Text is either under the square or inside the square, on the bottom, with a back shadow
  * If the text is inside the square, there is either a back shadow or a white backdrop

* If image is a directory, the title contains the amount of subItems

### Descriptions

* Some examples have additional descriptions of files, such as file date and file size

## Thoughts on design

### Shape

* Photos should appear as squares
* They should be slightly rounded, as it looks more soft and user friendly

### Title

*  Photos should not contain titles, as there's no helpful description for a majority of the photos.
  * It is possible in the future that titles can be added to match decisions on directory visuals

### Descriptions

* Photos should not contain titles, as there's no helpful decision for photos. You could possibly add descriptors for date created however some pictures are old photos scanned in where the date isn't accurate

## Additional Notes

* Photos should have margin between each other, something small
