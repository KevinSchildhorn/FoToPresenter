# Notes on Photo Browsing Groups

## Description of research

* Some groups are shown full width while others are squares
* Groups show title, the number of items
* Groups can have option button for options
* For adding new group, some have floating button others have button similar to grouping with plus in middle

## Thoughts on design

* Groups should match the styling of the photos, so rounded square, but slightly larger
* Groups should have title and number of items
* Groups should have option button, so users can have option to start a slideshow
* Adding a group should be a button similar to grouping, as there's no floating button in iOS by default
