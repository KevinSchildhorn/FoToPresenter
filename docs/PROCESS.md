# Process

This doc will go over the process of creating an app from scratch, and the current progress

## Design

The first step of the process was to design what the app is, and what it does.

I started with User Stories and Use Cases, basically wanting to decide what the user wants and what they expect to happen in the application

Once I knew what the user wanted to see, I went to research existing UI elements. Since I knew this app would be a gallery I researched what photo services such as google photos and flickr do in their apps and sites.

After that I moved onto the general design decisions
