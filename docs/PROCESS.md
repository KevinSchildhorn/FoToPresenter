# Process

This doc will go over the process of creating an app from scratch, and the current progress

## Design


1. The first step of the process was to design what the app is, and what it does.

### User Stories
I started with User Stories, seeing what the user wants from the app, and why they would use the app

### Use Cases
I then added some uses cases, wanting to decide what the user expects to happen in the application.
From these use cases I was able to make assumptions on the UX, which I wrote in the Details section for each Case. 
From these use cases I am also able to create UML diagrams, to specify what each element should contain, generally speaking. 

Once I knew what the user wanted to see, I went to research existing UI elements. Since I knew this app would be a gallery I researched what photo services such as google photos and flickr do in their apps and sites.

After that I moved onto the general design decisions
