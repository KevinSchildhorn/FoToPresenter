# Process

This doc will go over the process of creating an app from scratch, and the current progress

## UX Design

The first step of the process was to design what the app is, and what it does.

### 1. User Stories
* I started with User Stories, seeing what the user wants from the app, and why they would use the app

### 2. Use Cases
* I then added some uses cases, wanting to decide what the user expects to happen in the application.
  * From these use cases I am also able to create UML diagrams, to specify what each element should contain, generally speaking (Such as a screen having a search bar and performing a search action).

### 3. UI Research
* Once I knew what the user wanted to see, I went to research existing UI elements. Since I knew this app would be a gallery I researched what photo services such as google photos and flickr do in their apps and sites. In the future I will also research login screens and also gallery screens from other applications.

### 4. Decisions

* After that I moved onto the general design decisions. With both research and Use Cases I am able to decide on what elements should generally look like.
  * From the use cases I was able to make assumptions on the UX, which I wrote in the Thoughts on design for the research. For example what size and shape the photos in an element should be.

### 5. UI Design

I then made a figma for my designs and concepts. I also decided to make a page including the general theme of the app, including fonts, typography and colors. Here I added components and UI elements for the Gallery screen, and for the sign in screen. From here I can use these components to create the UI on mobile.

## Where next?

Next steps, are:
* Work on design system, and add UI elements to the app.
